Inspired by [logpresso Scanner](https://github.com/logpresso/CVE-2021-44228-Scanner) where I was able to contribute some parts :-)

And I have to do some automatic builds and releases with GitHub Actions...

## Build
Simple checkout and build via `mvn package`. GraalVM native-images can be created with `mvn package -Pnative`. An installed [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org) with native-image must be installed.

## Execute
In the release section you can find the JAR for all JRE 8+ environments. Also you can download a native binary for linux, macOS or windows.

To run the simple call `java -jar Log4j-Scanner-<version>.jar scanPath`. All ZIPs, JARs, WARs and EARs in the directory are scanned (also Fat JARs are supported). Also all directories are scanned.

You get a return code `0` when everything is fine, `1` if there are vulnereable log4j2 versions.
