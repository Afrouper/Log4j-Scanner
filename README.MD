Inspired by [logpresso Scanner](https://github.com/logpresso/CVE-2021-44228-Scanner) where I was able to contribute some
parts :-)

And I have to do some automatic builds and releases with GitHub Actions...

## Build

Simple checkout and build via `mvn package`. GraalVM native-images can be created with `mvn package -Pnative`. An
installed [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org) with native-image must be installed.

### Autoversioning

This project uses the [Maven Git Versioning Extension](https://github.com/qoomon/maven-git-versioning-extension) to
automaticly set the version numbers. For a flawless experience you need to disable this extension during project import
in IntelliJ. Disable it by adding `-Dversioning.disable=true` to Maven Importer VM options.

## Execute

In the release section you can find the JAR for all JRE 8+ environments. Also you can download a native binary for
linux, macOS or windows.

To execute the scanner simple call `java -jar Log4j-Scanner-<version>.jar scanPath` where 'scanPath' is to directory you
want to scan. All ZIPs, JARs, WARs and EARs in the directory are scanned (also Fat-JARs are supported). Also all
directories are scanned recursive. Native binaries can be executed without installed Java - please pick the correct for
you system.

**Attention:** After downloading the macOS binary you may need to remove the quarantine attribute. Do this
via `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Log4j-Scanner-mac-amd64`.

You get a return code `0` when everything is fine, `1` if there are vulnereable log4j2 versions.
